                      In the procurement process, the Importer uses GPS technology to track the distribution of
                      products.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                      But the dealer company Senesto has no such technology implemented within their business.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                      We recommend implementing such a system since it is easy to track the delivery process.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                      Furthermore, as an additional value addition step the company can notify the customers about the
                      delivery once the goods are loaded into the distribution vehicles.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                      This can be done by sending an email or an SMS so the customers can prepare with payments and
                      other necessities beforehand.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                      When the distribution network increases in a certain area (When distributors can attract new
                      customers) the process should be modified in a way the system can reroute the delivery route in a
                      cost-effective manner.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                      Also, a new database for Delivery vehicle drivers needs to be managed therefore can keep track of
                      the availability of drivers and enhance the transparency of the driver payment process.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      For the Return product batch tracking issue faced by Senesto, one possible solution that can be
                      implemented is adding barcode stickers in the products to easily figure out the details of the
                      batch numbers and other relevant information about the product.
                    </li>

                    It can be recommended to implement such a system therefore it will be easy to track the activities
                    in a more transparent manner and hence avoid any discrepancies. This will be of immense help in
                    their expansion process when they are to utilize more Delivery vehicles distributing in many
                    different areas, Owner himself or a responsible employee might find it hard to track if any frauds
                    are happening in the delivery phase from the points goods are dispatched from the warehouse until
                    they are received by the retailer.

                    Generally, it will be the same set of customers they will be providing the goods to, once a new
                    customer is added into the distribution network in a particular area it may come beneficial to
                    figure out the most efficient route of delivery and notify the driver assigned. Therefore it is
                    recommended to consider such a feature when implementing a new system where the system is able to
                    reroute the delivery according to the newly added customerâ€™s location.

                  <p className='points'>
                    In order to track the batch numbers of each product item for cosmetic products, the company can add
                    a barcode sticker containing batch details on each product item before re-packing and loading them
                    onto the delivery vehicles.
