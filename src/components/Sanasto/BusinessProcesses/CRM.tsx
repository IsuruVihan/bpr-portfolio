                        The customer base of the selected company Sanasto consists of medium and large scale pharmacies within their authorized distribution areas.

                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        The main issue in handling the customers is collecting the credits within the given period of time of 45 days.
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        As some of the customers exceed the time limit given for the payments the company has to contact the pharmacies frequently via telephone to give reminders.
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        Further, there are some customers that Sanasto had to blacklist because of the issues aroused in collecting credits.
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        Currently, Sanasto does not have a proper procedure to collect customer feedback which is the main element in customer relationship management.

                        As mentioned in the previous processes our main suggestion is to implement a system to address these issues and to enhance the functionality of Customer Relationship Management.

                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        In this system, the features to manage CRM processes can be implemented as a web-based or as a mobile application which is far more approachable.
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        Using the system customers can be provided with features to create separate accounts for their pharmacies.
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        It will help to implement a proper computerized customer database, an effective monitoring process on credit collecting, and for the customers, it will help to improve the efficiency of ordering processes and order tracking processes.

                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        Notifying the customer about the time limit to complete the payments can be automated and effective using this system.
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        In-app notifications, SMS, and emails can be used to send these notices.

                      <br/>
                      <li>
                        Surveys can be included in the system to be completed by the customer once in 6 months, to collect the customer feedback on the service provided by Sanasto.

                        Since Sanasto doesnâ€™t have in-house technical resources or human resources to implement an automated system, the required service to develop the system can be outsourced and they can consult experts in a software development firm.

                        The initial cost of developing a system is high but the benefits that can be gained through the system and the way it enhances the functionality of the entire company proves that moving for a software system is worthy and would be cost-effective  in the future.

                        Since the selected company is currently following a manual process to complete the tasks in customer relationship management, having an information system improves the efficiency considerably.
